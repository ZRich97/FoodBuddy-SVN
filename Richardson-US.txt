1. As a college student, I want access to varied recipes using ingredients I have on hand, so I can
eat different meals without shopping too often.
2. As a vegetarian, I want to view recipes fitting my dietary restrictions, so that I can more easily
adhere to them while still having varied meals.
3. As a busy user, I want access to quick, easy recipes, so I can go about my day without worrying
about what Iâ€™ll be eating each day.
